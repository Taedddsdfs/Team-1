implemented the program counter and data memory as well as implemented the pipelining logic including for: flushing, stalling and forwarding . I resolved all the conflicts when implmenting the single-cycle full RISCV ISA onto the pipeline and made significant contributions to the sign extension unit. I created the initial instruction ROM built off Jihwans inital model, which was later replaced by Elsons and attempted to implement interrupts.
