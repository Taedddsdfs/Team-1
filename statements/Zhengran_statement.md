### Introduction 

My main contribution in the group was implementing the datapath and control logic needed for pipelining and cache. I designed the sign-extension unit and control unit for the single-cycle CPU, then extended them with the PRDE stage and pipelined top module. I also implemented the 2-way data cache module and helped debug the cache-related testbench so that the pipelined CPU passes the provided tests.
